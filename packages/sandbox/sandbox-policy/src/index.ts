/**
 * The sandbox POLICY home (`ctx.sandboxPolicy`): the single owner of the
 * deployment's sandbox fallbacks plus per-session resolution: the file-effect
 * {@link SandboxMode}, the `workspace-write` root, and the override kit (the
 * `sandbox/mode` event, its fold, and its write path; the fold is the
 * `sandboxMode` session-projection unit registered here, while the event and
 * write path come from `./session-mode.ts`).
 * Before each agent request, the owner also contributes the resolved policy to
 * the cache-safe runtime-context snapshot. The agent loop logs that snapshot as
 * model history, so replay reconstructs the same mode and root the enforcing
 * consumers resolve without rewriting the stable system prompt.
 *
 * Enforcing filesystem, one-shot bash, and terminal backends read the SAME
 * resolved policy here. The context describes that policy without inventorying
 * capabilities, while each backend retains its own enforcement dialect and each
 * tool owns its operation-specific denial and escalation guidance. The service
 * reads session state once at each operation boundary; executors and providers
 * remain session-free.
